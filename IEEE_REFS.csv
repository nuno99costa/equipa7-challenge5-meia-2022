In the Philippines setting, young coconut or commonly known as buko are classified into three stages namely: Malauhog, Malakanin and Malakatad. In this paper, a classification system is proposed in order to establish a more scientific method of predicting the maturity stage of young coconut. Sound vibrations were created by a constant source of vibration from a vibration motor then the sound signatures or acoustic response were collected by the vibration sensor. The vibrations were collected three (3) times from the three (3) faces and three (3) edges of each samples, hence resulting to eighteen (18) sound signatures for every coconut. The model was trained and tested using 150 samples. Nine (9) sound signatures out of the eighteen was identified to be significant in the training phase after PCA has been applied.

Presently, there are many fruits and literature about driving drowsiness detection method. However, most of them are devoted to find a universal drowsiness detection method, while ignore the individual driver differences. This paper proposes a real-time driving drowsiness detection algorithm that considers the individual differences of driver. A deep cascaded convolutional neural network was constructed to detect the face region, which avoids the problem of poor accuracy caused by artificial feature extraction. Based on the Dlib toolkit, the landmarks of frontal driver facial in a frame are found. According to the eyes landmarks, a new parameter, called Eyes Aspect Ratio, is introduced to evaluate the drowsiness of driver in the current frame. Taking into account differences in size of driver's eyes, the proposed algorithm consists of two modules: offline training and online monitoring. In the first module, a unique fatigue state classifier, based on Support Vector Machines, was trained which taking the Eyes Aspect Ratio as input. Then, in the second module, the trained classifier is application to monitor the state of driver online. Because the fatigue driving state is gradually produced, a variable which calculated by number of drowsy frames per unit time is introduced to assess the drowsiness of driver. Through comparative experiments, we demonstrate this algorithm outperforms current driving drowsiness detection approaches in both accuracy and speed. In simulated driving applications, the proposed algorithm detects the drowsy state of driver quickly from 640 * 480 resolution images at over 20fps and 94.80% accuracy.

However, due to urbanization, this is becoming unbalanced and threatens to human life. This paper proposed the techniques to measure the quality of fruits impudent. It is highly suitable to create awareness among people against the use of decomposed fruits due to temperature changes, rough handling and poor packaging. The proposed method is based on image segmentation with ML support. The basic need of data set is taken from GoogleNet, which has a lower error rate of 3.1% among other models such as ResNet and Alexnet. The total number of images available is 54122 with all possible decomposed types of 45 per fruit. In this research work, CNN model is proposed and analysed 8 classes of fruits along with the various matrices to predict the high-quality fruit and classify them based on the grades. The accuracy of this system is 94.2% for class 3 (banana) and 99.1% for class 8 (orange) fruit. This entire system is progressed using CNN model with a stride of 256⋆ 256, fully connected layer is 4096 and softMax is 1000. Poling type is SPPnet that takes one time scanning of image to construct the attributes of the entire poling model. These specifications are good to classify the fruits impudent and level of accuracy is increased with training and learning rate. Another advantage is that this system does not require any additional accelerator block.

Within this context, this research presents a new methodology aimed at supporting accurate automatic olive-fruit grading by using computer vision techniques and feature modeling. For its development, a total of 3600 olive-fruits from nine varieties were photographed, stochastically distributing the individuals on the scene, using an ad-hoc designed an imaging chamber. Then, an image analysis algorithm, based on mathematical morphology, was designed to individually segment olives and extract descriptive features to estimate their major and minor axes and their mass. Regarding its accuracy for the individual segmentation of olive-fruits, the algorithm was proven through 117 captures containing 11 606 fruits, producing only six fruit-segmentation mistakes. Furthermore, by linearly correlating the data obtained by image analysis and the corresponding reference measurements, models for estimating the three features were computed. Then, the models were tested on 2700 external validation samples, giving relative errors below 0.80% and 1.05% for the estimation of the major and minor axis length for all varieties, respectively. In the case of estimating olive-fruit mass, the models provided relative errors never exceeding 1.16%. The ability of the developed algorithm to individually segment olives stochastically positioned, along with the low error rates of around 1% reported by the estimation models for the three features, makes the methodology a promising alternative to be integrated into a new generation of improved and non-invasive olive classification machines.

We suggest a neural network approach to classify apple defects. Due to the various fruit varieties classification is a challenging task. We suggested a system of classification based on an artificial bee colony algorithm (FSCABC) and a neural feeding network to classify fruit more precisely (FNN). First, fruit photographs were purchased using a digital camera and then, using a break and fuse algorithm, the backdrop of each image was stripped. To catch the fruits, we used a square window, where we downloaded the images in 256 x 256. Second, each fruit image was derived from a color histogram, texture and shape features to make a feature space. Thirdly, a major components method was used to minimize the dimensions of function space. The function is reduced and the weights and preferences are eventually trained on the FNN of the FSCABC algorithm. We have used the K-fold cross-validation approach to improve the capacity of the FNN. Test findings revealed that the SAFCABC-FNN achieved a precision of 89.1 percentage in 1653 fruit imagery in all 18 categories.

It is the most important factor since it reduces both the potential and the quality of the growing crops. Fruits are one of the most important sources of nutrients in plants; although, there's a diverse range of diseases that affect the quality and development of fruits. Machine vision approaches have been developed to deal with these challenges these approaches are very useful in that they not only identify diseases/infections early but also tag them. In this paper, a deep CNN-based approach for disease classification of citrus fruits into healthy and infected classes is proposed.

However, the particularities of each classification problem make it difficult, if not impossible, to select a general technique that is applicable to all types of fruit. In this paper, the combinations of four machine learning techniques and three color spaces (RGB, HSV, and L*a*b*) were evaluated with regard to their ability to classify Cape gooseberry fruits. To this end, 925 Cape gooseberry fruit samples were collected, and each fruit was manually classified into one of seven different classes according to its level of ripeness. The color values of each fruit image in the three color spaces and their corresponding ripening stages were organized for training and validation following a fivefold cross-validation strategy in an iterative process repeated 100 times. According to the results, the classification of Cape gooseberry fruits by their ripeness level was sensitive to both the color space and the classification technique used.

The tropical fruits are grown mostly in South East Asia, Thailand and in Malaysia. Most of the fruits are usually recognized by its strong aroma and unique taste. These fruits are identified as the most precious fruit in India for the effective health nourishment benefits. The appearance of the fruits generally identifies the quality and ripeness of the fruits. The Quality of the fruit is also determined by the strength of color, texture, aroma and the maturity level of the fruit. This identification of the maturity levels when done manually leads to many flaws. Thus techniques like computer vision, machine learning are used for easy classification of the fruits in to various stages. A detailed review of the multiple fruit classification methods are done with both Machine Learning and Deep Learning Techniques and a comparison is made on the accuracy obtained by these techniques. The feature extractions are done on the different datasets based on size, shape, color and texture. In image processing techniques there are significant research areas to work on the image but classification of image is one of the most complex area. The classification of multiple fruit images are categorized in two main ways of Supervised and Unsupervised methods in Machine Learning Technique. Both the methods have their properties and functions. The main challenge is to obtain a proper and desired result from a noisy fruit image as compared to that of the normal image. Fruit maturity detection is divided into different stages depending on the type of detection method used.

Therefore, it is necessary to develop fast, portable and cost-effective techniques without harming fruits to meet demand of consumer for fresh and healthy fruits. Visual appearance is an important method to obtain external characteristic (size, color) of fruits for grading or sorting. This work aims to develop custom design non-destructive quality evaluation system to reduce conventional destructive quality evaluations processes of fruits.

Design of an IoT Based Ensemble Machine Learning Model for Fruit Classification and Quality Detection,P. Nirale; M. Madankar,"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, G H Raisoni College of Engineering, Nagpur, India; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, G H Raisoni College of Engineering, Nagpur, India",2022 10th International Conference on Emerging Trends in Engineering and Technology - Signal and Information Processing (ICETET-SIP-22),15-Jun-22,2022,,,1,6,"Classification of fruit imagery for identification and quality detection of fruits is a multidomain task, which involves pre-processing, segmentation, feature extraction, feature selection, identification and post-processing. Existing models for fruit classification and quality identification use various machine learning and deep learning methods for general purpose processing. Due to which, their accuracy and precision performance is limited. In order to improve this performance for application-specific fruit imagery, this text proposes a novel ensemble learning-based framework, that utilizes ensemble of adaptive Naïve Bayes (aNB), multiple support vector machines (MSVM), varying depth random forests (VDRF), and interpolated k Nearest Neighbor (ikNN) methods. These methods utilize color, texture, shape and convolution features in order to represent input fruit imagery into multiple domains. These feature vectors are given to a variance maximization layer, which assists in feature reduction for reducing classification delay, and improving accuracy of quality prediction. The ensemble model utilizes adaptive feature selection, which is controlled via Genetic Algorithm (GA) based optimization, and assists in identification of optimum model parameters for accuracy maximization. The GA based ensemble model is designed in dual mode, and applied for different fruit image training and validation sets. Due to this, the model is capable of achieving an accuracy of 97.9% for fruit classification, and 93.8% for quality detection. The model is also able to reduce the delay of classification and quality detection when compared with state-of-the-art methods. This is possible due to use of variance maximization for feature selection and classification. The model was further evaluated on multiple datasets, and was observed to be tunable for different fruit types via complete retraining and validation. This characteristic assists in improving scalability of the proposed model, thereby making it applicable for a wide variety of fruit types. This text evaluates the model on Apple and Orange fruits, and recommends steps which must be followed in order to tune the model for any type of fruit for optimum accuracy performance.",2157-0485,978-1-6654-6741-4,10.1109/ICETET-SIP-2254415.2022.9791718,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9791718,Fruit;quality;accuracy;ensemble;Genetic Algorithm;machine;learning;fruit type,Support vector machines;Deep learning;Training;Adaptation models;Shape;Feature extraction;Delays,crops;feature extraction;genetic algorithms;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);object detection;pattern classification;quality control;support vector machines,ensemble learning-based framework;multiple support vector machines;convolution features;feature vectors;feature reduction;classification delay;quality prediction;ensemble model;adaptive feature selection;genetic algorithm based optimization;optimum model parameters;accuracy maximization;validation sets;fruit classification;quality detection;fruit types;optimum accuracy performance;ensemble machine learning model;feature extraction;quality identification;general purpose processing;application-specific fruit imagery;fruit image training;interpolated k nearest neighbor methods,,,,21,IEEE,15-Jun-22,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

The number of harvested berries per plant is strongly correlated with the resulting quality. Therefore, early yield forecasting can enable a focused thinning of berries to ensure a high quality end product. Traditionally yield estimation is done by extrapolating from a small sample size and by utilizing historic data. Moreover, it needs to be carried out by skilled experts with much experience in this field. Berry detection in images offers a cheap, fast and non-invasive alternative to the otherwise time-consuming and subjective on-site analysis by experts. We apply fully convolutional neural networks on images acquired with the Phenoliner, a field phenotyping platform. We count single berries in images to avoid the error-prone detection of grapevine clusters. Clusters are often overlapping and can vary a lot in the size which makes the reliable detection of them difficult. We address especially the detection of white grapes directly in the vineyard. The detection of single berries is formulated as a classification task with three classes, namely 'berry', 'edge' and 'background'. A connected component algorithm is applied to determine the number of berries in one image. We compare the automatically counted number of berries with the manually detected berries in 60 images showing Riesling plants in vertical shoot positioned trellis (VSP) and semi minimal pruned hedges (SMPH).

Farmers have to observe and determine whether a leaf was infected by naked eyes. This process is unreliable, inconsistent, and error prone. Several works on deep learning techniques for detecting leaf diseases had been proposed. Most of them built their models based on limited resolution images using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In this research, we aim at detecting early disease on plant leaves with small disease blobs, which can only be detected with higher resolution images, by an artificial neural network (ANN) approach. After a pre-processing step using a contrast enhancement method, all the infested blobs are segmented for the whole dataset. A list of several measurement-based features that represents the blobs are chosen and then selected based on their influences on the model's performance using a wrapper-based feature selection algorithm, which is built based on a hybrid metaheuristic. The chosen features are used as inputs for an ANN. We compare the results obtained using our methods with another approach using popular CNN models (AlexNet, VGG16, ResNet-50) enhanced with transfer learning. The ANN's results are better than those of CNNs using a simpler network structure (89.41% vs 78.64%, 79.92%, and 84.88%, respectively). This shows that our approach can be implemented on low-end devices such as smartphones, which will be of great assistance to farmers on the field.",2169-3536,,10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3031914,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9229136,Neural network;image classification;plant disease;feature selection;precision agriculture,Diseases;Feature extraction;Training;Agriculture;Artificial neural networks;Plants (biology),agriculture;crops;feature selection;feedforward neural nets;image classification;image enhancement;image representation;image resolution;image segmentation;learning (artificial intelligence);plant diseases,hybrid metaheuristic;infested blobs segmentation;image resolution;network structure;ANN;transfer learning;wrapper-based feature selection;measurement-based features;contrast enhancement;artificial neural network;disease blobs;plant leaves;leaf diseases;deep learning;agricultural productivity;fruits;global food security;crop plants;plant disease;hybrid metaheuristic feature selection;feed-forward neural network;mango leaves;disease classification,,18,,41,CCBYNCND,19-Oct-20,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals

One major obstacle, which prevents Vietnam from exporting some fruit species to western countries such as mangoes, is the irregular quality of the harvested fruits. Various research aimed to solve this problem by proposing different methods of estimating the weights of the fruits to determine anomalies. However, most methods are only tested for their maximum accuracy under favorable conditions with expensive equipments, and are therefore often not suitable for the poor farming regions of the developing countries. In this paper, with the main focus being mangoes, we would like to study a simpler approach using a combination of images processing techniques and support vector machine (SVM) for determining the approximate weight range of the fruits.

Berry thinning is one of the most important tasks in grape cultivation to achieve an ideal bunch shape and to make sufficient space for individual berries. A successful practice by skilled grape farmers in Japan is using the number of berries in a bunch to guide the thinning process; hence, a technique for automatically counting the number of berries in a working bunch has been long desired by farmers to improve the efficiency of the thinning task. This research presents a novel end-to-end berry-counting technique based on a deep neural network (DNN), and its contributions are as follows. First, because a DNN requires massive training data, a novel data augmentation technique simulating the thinning process is proposed. Second, a new location-sensitive object detection model that integrates explicit location information and supplementary classification loss into a state-of-the-art instance segmentation model was proposed for detecting the number of berries in a working bunch with a high accuracy. Third, a set of features, together with their extraction algorithms, is designed for predicting the number of berries in a bunch (3D counting) using the berries detected on a single 2D image.

Edible oils take important parts in people's daily food, and taking good-quality oils plays an important role to the health. However, as the supply cannot satisfy the market demand and some good-quality edible oils are expensive, many incidents of adulterated and fraudulent edible oils have been reported. In Taiwan, some common adulterated edible oils and fraudulent edible oils incidents include (1) mixing good-quality oils with low-quality oils, but labeling the products as high-quality products; (2) importing cheap and low-quality oils abroad, but labeling them as good-quality ones; and (3) fraudulent labeling with wrong ingredients. Even though high-tech laboratories can differentiate the products and identify ingredients, the popular technologies demand high costs in terms of money, time, and man power. The general cannot easily access these technologies and should only depend on occasional reports from the governments or from some trusted institutions. Furthermore, the jurisdiction process takes a long time, and the punishment is relatively light, compared to the illegal interests. It is, therefore, crucial to develop new technologies that can effectively and efficiently differentiate different edible oils or even identifying concerned ingredients in edible oils.

For this, the grey oyster mushroom requires attention for having a smart grading system for helping the agricultural farmers to ease their job in grading them before transporting mushrooms to a supermarket.

Manual eye observation is still conducted in this traditional classification for grey oyster mushrooms. Even though most research works are conducted with the inter-class task for a bigger group of mushroom classification, the intra-class mushroom study is still limited and needs attention, which compares the available image to a smaller level or class. In this paper, intra-class classification, image processing, and deep learning are utilized, with an introduction of grey oyster mushroom classification using CNN as our classification engine is proposed. Here, it is necessary to evaluate the grading system traditionally conducted manually by farmers based on the FAMA guidance. The study also aims to design a grey oyster mushroom classification network model. The VGG16 pre-trained network model will be studied and utilized in this study.

So, hundreds of local fruits are cultivated through the yearlong by the local farmers. But in recent times some obsolete fruits like apple, blueberry, cherry, grape, orange, peach, raspberry, strawberry etc. are getting popularity amongst local consumers of Bangladesh and that is the reason why local farmers are now contemplating towards the commercial cultivation of these obsolete fruits. But there are too many obstacles in that process of commercial cultivation including weather demand, quality of soil, cultivation technology, diseases, insects attack etc. Most of the time diseases of these fruits notice our eyes when fruits are attacked and we cannot help but let the fruits get rotten and suffer the financial loss too.

The research focuses on O-H and C-H overtone features of fruit and its correlation with NIRS and therefore opens a new dimension of fruit classification problems using NIRS. Eleven fruits, which include apple, cherry, hass, kiwi, grapes, mango, melon, orange, loquat, plum, and apricot, were used in this study to cover physical characteristics such as peel thinness, pulp, seed thickness, and size. NIR spectral data is collected using the industry-standard F-750 fruit quality meter (wavelength range 300-1100nm) for all fruit mentioned above. Different shallow machine learning architectures were trained to classify fruits using spectral feature vectors. At first, using 83 features vectors within the range of 725-975nm (3nm-resolution) and then using only four features of wavelength 770nm, 840nm, 910nm, and 960nm (corresponding to O-H and C-H overtone features). For the 83 spectral features range as an input, the QDA classifier achieved a cross-validation accuracy of 100% and a test data accuracy of 93.02%. For the four features vector as an input, the QDA classifier achieved a cross-validation accuracy of 97.1% and test data accuracy of 90.38%.

In Brazil, it is estimated that the economic losses directly related to production, the cost of pest control and in the loss of export markets, are between USD 120 and 200 million/year. The species of the genus Anastrepha are among the fruit flies economically important in the America tropics and subtropics with approximately 300 known species, of which 120 are recorded in Brazil. However, few species are economically important in Brazil and are considered pests of quarantine significance by regulatory agencies.

However, classifying papaya fruit maturity given six ripeness stages with precision remains a challenge since most changes happen inside the fruit rather than the external characteristics, which are quite similar between stages. Using internal properties in classification would require destructive and time-consuming laboratory tests. With the emergence of deep learning and imaging technologies, data with high dimensions, which correlates with internal and external characteristics of an object such as those produced by hyperspectral cameras, can be processed to perform a high-level intelligent classification task without impairing the fruit. In this paper, we present an AI-derived non-destructive approach that utilizes hyperspectral and visible-light images in estimating the papaya fruit maturity stage and implements multimodality via late fusion of imaging-specific networks. The proposed multimodal architecture is composed of imaging-specific deep convolutional neural networks as base learners and a meta-learner that executes late fusion of the dual unimodal networks. Multiclass logistic regression and averaging are explored as the meta-learners of the multimodal fused network that generates the final classifications. Experimental results of the proposed multimodal-late fused models are compared with the multimodal-feature concatenation approach for estimation of papaya fruit maturity, and our proposed model framework obtained an improved F1-score of up to 0.97.

The challenge lies in the complex signal processing methods during the pre-processing of the raw Raman spectrum which highly relies on human expertise. Thus, this study aims on developing an automated and optimized signal processing algorithm that could eliminate the need of an experienced personnel in processing the raw spectra which mostly relies on experience and intuition. The process involves peak selection, noise smoothing using Savitsky-Golay filters, interpolation and peak fitting. This article focuses on optimizing the Raman spectra peak fitting during pre-processing before significant features are extracted from the peaks to be fed as input into the machine learning model. Three profiles for peak fitting that have been applied are Gaussian, Lorentzian and Voigt. The findings show that after optimization, the best fit percentage for Gaussian profile is 33%, Lorentzian 42% and Voigt 24% which is in line with the manual peak fitting method where Lorentzian profile dominates the best fit. This result shows that the Lorentzian profile or its derivative could be used as the dominant profile for automating peak fitting during raw Raman signal pre-processing.",,978-1-6654-8529-6,10.1109/CSPA55076.2022.9781970,Ministry of Higher Education; ,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9781970,Oil palm fruit;Raman spectroscopy;Ripeness;Peak fitting;Pre-processing,Smoothing methods;Oils;Fitting;Raman scattering;Signal processing algorithms;Signal processing;Feature extraction,agriculture;crops;feature extraction;feature selection;image classification;image filtering;interpolation;learning (artificial intelligence);quality control;Raman spectra;smoothing methods,signal processing;peak selection;Raman spectra peak fitting;Lorentzian profile;oil palm classification;fresh fruit bunches;pre-harvesting;Savitsky-Golay filters;interpolation;features extraction;machine learning;noise smoothing,,1,,11,IEEE,27-May-22,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Identification of simple images like fruits, scenery, etc. may be a convenient task for humans, but for images like that of a PCB, minute observation is required. When there is a huge dataset containing a variety of PCB images, it is very difficult for humans to classify the defective and non-defective PCBs. PCB has joint soldering, component placing, connections, etc. which can be the factors for classification. PCB defects can be then identified via model training through Machine Learning (ML). Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is proposed for classifying the PCB to be defective or not. The model is trained for two classes: defective and non-defective PCB images and then the classification is done as per the PCB faults and parameters.

When done manually, postharvest grading of Calamansi is a laborious operation. Thus, an effective method of assessing them according to size, color, and maturity is required to assist calamansi farmers in grading and classifying it non-destructively with precision and accuracy. Deep learning architectures have been useful in a wide range of agricultural applications including classifying, grading fruits, and quality recognition. The goal of the study is to compare the performance of four deep learning architectures: VGG16, ResNet50, InceptionV3, and DenseNet201 in classifying Calamansi. Three types of optimizers were considered in the training including Adam, SGD, and RMSProp. Furthermore, data augmentation is applied to the datasets to reduce overfitting and increase variation in the training datasets because of limited data. With Adam as optimizer, classification accuracies resulted to 96.98%, 91.48%, 27.95% and 65.95% for ResNet50, VGG16, InceptionV3 and DenseNet201, respectively.

However, to get the matured palm oil bunches, current technology still uses the experience of the harvester in identifying the ripe bunch. The majority of harvesters still use a chisel or long sickle to harvest palm oil bunch from its' tree. They have to determine the ripe bunch from the ground. So, the traditional harvesting method is prone to human error during the determination of the maturity of the palm oil bunch. Thus, this project proposes a real-time ripe palm oil bunch detection using YOLOv3 Algorithm to improve the harvesting process. The pre- processing phase of this project includes data acquisition (collecting palm oil bunch images and videos) and labelling those images based on the respective classes (palm oil maturity level). After the pre-processing phase was completed, the Darknet framework was installed and used for the training and testing phase. The detection model and the dataset were compiled and trained using a pre-trained detection model prepared by the Darknet. A software application was created as a system interface using Python libraries. Tkinter connected it with the Darknet framework using the Darknet command. The outcome of this project's experiment shows that the YOLOv3 Algorithm was able to detect and differentiate the maturity of palm oil bunch's level with learning saturation (overfitting) of 6000th iterations.

Harvesting FFB from oil palm trees at its peak ripeness stage is crucial to maximise the oil extraction rate (OER) and quality. In current harvesting practices, misclassification of FFB ripeness can occur due to human error, resulting in OER loss. Therefore, a vision-based ripe FFB detection system is proposed as the first step in a robotic FFB harvesting system. In this work, live camera input is fed into a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model known as YOLOv4 to detect the presence of ripe FFBs on the oil palm trees in real-time. Once a ripe FFB is detected on the tree, a signal is transmitted via ROS to the robotic harvesting mechanism. To train the YOLOv4 model, a large number of ripe FFB images were collected using an Intel Realsense Camera D435 with a resolution of  $1920\times 1080$ . During data acquisition, a subject matter expert assisted in classifying the FFBs in terms of ripe or unripe.

Due to the lack of automatic counting of Xanthoceras sorbifolium Bunge, this paper proposed a counting method based on deep learning, thus predicting and estimating the fruit yield of Xanthoceras sorbifolium Bunge quickly and effectively, and promoting the development of Xanthoceras sorbifolium Bunge planting industry. Experiments were conducted with deep learning models including SSD, YOLOv2, YOLOv2-tiny, YOLOv3, YOLOv3-tiny, YOLOv4,YOLOv5s and YOLOv5x, respectively, and the optimal model was selected. In view of the similar color of Xanthoceras sorbifolium Bunge fruit and leaves, in order to improve the accuracy of detection and counting, first of all, the experiment was to improve the contrast of the original data set twice. Secondly, the data set of green Malus pumila Mill and Pyrus spp cultivars with similar fruit type was mixed with the data set of Xanthoceras sorbifolium Bunge for data augmentation. In order to further study the influence of different flight modes of UAV on the prediction results, a comparative test was conducted on three flight modes. There is the optimal performance of YOLOv3, with the IOU 98.84%, and there is the highest counting accuracy of YOLOV3-tiny, up to 98.05%. Moreover, the YOLOv3-tiny model is suitable for the counting statistics of Xanthoceras sorbifolium Bunge data not only in large area collected by UAV, but also in local area collected by daily mobile phone, so that it is suitable for predicting and estimating the yield of Xanthoceras sorbifolium Bunge. Appropriately increasing the image contrast can improve the accuracy of the detection and counting of Xanthoceras sorbifolium Bunge fruit, but if the contrast increases too much, the detection accuracy will decrease. The accuracy of detection and counting can also be improved by training with mixed fruit data sets of similar color and fruit shape. The best value of recognition and counting accuracy can be achieved by the two modes of lateral flight and vertical flight, respectively.

To assess this relationship three Chemometrics and machine learning methods were used: Principal Component Regression (PCR), Partial Least Squares (PLS) and Multilayer Perceptron Regression (MLPR). Spectral Data augmentation was used to generate more observations from the original spectra. Our results suggest Quetzaly has a higher Brix content and that all three methods can be used to predict it with confidence.

This study aims to classify the native banana fruit to South and Southern Asia (Musa acuminata) using the image-based deep transfer networks of ResNet101, MobileNetV2, and InceptionV3, and machine learning algorithms, including classification tree (CTree), Naïve Bayes algorithm (NB), k-nearest neighbors (KNN) and support vector machine (SVM). A total of 1,164 images, derived from 194 banana tier subjects with different orientations were utilized. Color channel thresholding in CIELab(L*a*b*) color space was applied to extract the spectral (RGB, HSV, YCbCr, L*a*b*), textural (correlation, contrast, entropy, homogeneity, energy) and morphological (total area) features. These 18-feature vectors were further simplified into two most significant features (S and V) using combined neighborhood component analysis and principal component analysis (hybrid NCA-PCA). The length of the top middle finger of the banana tier was added to the features. The classification tree (CTree), regardless of feature set, was validated to have the best performance, with accuracy of 91.28% and inference time of 19.34seconds. In addition, NB, KNN and SVM models provided acceptable performance with 89.72%, 89.30%, and 89.36% accuracies, respectively. However, the deep transfer networks did not provide acceptable classification results (with ResNet101 having the highest accuracy of 50.01% among the networks used). Lastly, the proposed machine learning models served as a feasible approach in the postharvest classification of Musa acuminata.",2572-7621,978-1-6654-3240-5,10.1109/R10-HTC53172.2021.9641575,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9641575,Banana Variety Classification;Computer Vision;Machine Learning;Musa Acuminata;Postharvest Fruit Classification;Deep Learning,Support vector machines;Machine learning algorithms;Image color analysis;Computational modeling;Fingers;Crops;Machine learning,computer vision;crops;deep learning (artificial intelligence);feature extraction;image classification;image colour analysis;image segmentation;naive Bayes methods;nearest neighbour methods;principal component analysis;support vector machines,vision-based postharvest analysis;Musa acuminata;feature-based machine learning;human-related limitations;visual recognition;computer vision approach;native banana fruit;Southern Asia;image-based deep transfer networks;machine learning algorithms;classification tree;CTree;k-nearest neighbors;KNN;194 banana tier subjects;color channel thresholding;morphological features;18-feature vectors;combined neighborhood component analysis;principal component analysis;machine learning models;InceptionV3 datasets;MobileNetV2 datasets;ResNet101 datasets;postharvest crop classification;RGB;HSV;YCbCr;L*a*b*;hybrid NCA-PCA;SVM models;NB models;time 19.34 s,,4,,27,IEEE,22-Dec-21,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Weed Identification Using Deep Learning and Image Processing in Vegetable Plantation,X. Jin; J. Che; Y. Chen,"College of Mechanical and Electronic Engineering, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing, China; Department of Artificial Intelligence Algorithm, Kedacom Inc., Shanghai, China; College of Mechanical and Electronic Engineering, Nanjing Forestry University, Nanjing, China",IEEE Access,20-Jan-21,2021,9,,10940,10950,"Weed identification in vegetable plantation is more challenging than crop weed identification due to their random plant spacing. So far, little work has been found on identifying weeds in vegetable plantation. Traditional methods of crop weed identification used to be mainly focused on identifying weed directly; however, there is a large variation in weed species. This paper proposes a new method in a contrary way, which combines deep learning and image processing technology. Firstly, a trained CenterNet model was used to detect vegetables and draw bounding boxes around them. Afterwards, the remaining green objects falling out of bounding boxes were considered as weeds. In this way, the model focuses on identifying only the vegetables and thus avoid handling various weed species. Furthermore, this strategy can largely reduce the size of training image dataset as well as the complexity of weed detection, thereby enhancing the weed identification performance and accuracy. To extract weeds from the background, a color index-based segmentation was performed utilizing image processing. The employed color index was determined and evaluated through Genetic Algorithms (GAs) according to Bayesian classification error. During the field test, the trained CenterNet model achieved a precision of 95.6%, a recall of 95.0%, and a  $F_{1}$  score of 0.953, respectively. The proposed index −19R + 24G −2B ≥ 862 yields high segmentation quality with a much lower computational cost compared to the wildly used ExG index. These experiment results demonstrate the feasibility of using the proposed method for the ground-based weed identification in vegetable plantation.",2169-3536,,10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3050296,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9317797,Weed identification;deep learning;image processing;genetic algorithms;color index,Deep learning;Agriculture;Image color analysis;Training;Image segmentation;Indexes;Image processing,agricultural products;agriculture;Bayes methods;computer vision;crops;feature extraction;genetic algorithms;image classification;image colour analysis;image processing;image segmentation;learning (artificial intelligence);vegetation,vegetable plantation;crop;identifying weeds;weed species;deep learning;image processing technology;trained CenterNet model;vegetables;bounding boxes;training image dataset;weed detection;weed identification performance;utilizing image processing;ground-based weed identification,,16,,28,CCBY,8-Jan-21,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals
